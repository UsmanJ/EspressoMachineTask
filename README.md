MyBuilder Coding Test
================

Crap Code
---------

We have deliberately written a lot of crap PHP code in the crapCode.php file in the root directory.
Have a look at the code now and tell us all the problems you can find in that code and explain for each
one why it is a problem.


Espresso Machine
----------------

We drink a lot of coffee in the office, we spent 600 pounds on a professional coffee machine, buy the best beans and
used to have a coffee can mountain until we destroyed it playing bowling with the office swivel chairs at a party...

Your challenge is to write concrete implementations of the following interfaces ExpressoMachine, BeansContainer and WaterContainer.

We have already written a set of unit tests which will be used to test your implementation

* You MUST NOT change any of the existing methods defined in the interface
* You MUST fully implement all the interfaces
* You can add any additional classes, interfaces or other code that you feel you need
* You should not print or display anything
* You may add additional methods to your implementation
* Exceptions are listed in the order they should be thrown
* The standard WaterContainer contains 2 litres but other sizes can be attached. common sizes are the 10 litre or mains water supply
* The standard BeanContainer holds 50 beans but other sizes can be attached. A 200 bean container is common
